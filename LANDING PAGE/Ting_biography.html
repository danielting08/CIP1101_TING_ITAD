            <div align="justify">
            <p font face="Garamond" font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup>1</sup>My childhood years are very memorable, it was amazing because my i'd experience the all the games that i play on the streets.
                <sup>2</sup>I'd remember the moments that my mom force me to put on blanket at my back before i go play outside.
                <sup>3</sup>I have so many random friends every single day, it was so fun to meet and play with them.
                <sup>4</sup>One day, I'm on a vacation in my province ilocos, me and my cousins are swimming on "Karayan".
                <sup>5</sup>Me and my dad always go hiking to the mountain to feed our animals, like cows, chicken, carabao, goats, ducks, fish.
                <sup>6</sup>I learned how to plant a crop, how to harvest, how to cook at the young age, how to climb a tree.
                <sup>7</sup>I remember when i was alone on the woods walking home, their was an big snake hanging on the tree, luckily he didn't try to attack me.
                <sup>8</sup>At the young age my mother and father seperated.
                <sup>9</sup>My mom took me and i studied in chinese school, kindergarden to grade 2.
                <sup>10</sup>As my father take me grade 3 to grade 5 and I came back to my mother at grade 6.
                <sup>11</sup>I am the only child in our family, My mother is an pure chinese and my father is an Ilocano.
                <sup>12</sup>I learned to speak and understand chinese and ilocano.
                <sup>13</sup>Growing up, I had a very loving family, I remember my grandfather used to do magic everyday on me and it was so magnificent.
                <sup>14</sup>Another beautiful thing I can remember is flying kites. It used to be one of the most exciting things of my childhood. Even the older members of the family participated with us. We used to fly kites on our terrace.
                <sup>15</sup>I still remember the day I decided to let go of my fears and dived into the deep end of the pool. The instant I jumped into the water, the fear was gone, and I swam like a fish to the other end of the pool. That day also taught me a valuable lesson about taking the first step in any daunting task. 
                <sup>16</sup>These feelings and memories are priceless. I wish if I could go back to my past and see childhood again, that would be amazing. But I know it’s not possible. I miss my childhood a lot. 
                <sup>17</sup>I remember my auntie cooks everyday an ilocano dishes and it was so very delicious, i can't forget the taste of her cook.
                <sup>18</sup>These memories are priceless and I keep smiling when I think about these golden days. 
                <sup>19</sup>I missed the good old days that we have no problem, we don't have to think about life, we just enjoying our childhood moments.
                <sup>20</sup>We all have lots of past memories in our lives. But I think childhood memories are the best memories that make us happy and delighted. You can’t deny that we all have some memories that are very special to us.

            <p font face="Garamond" font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup>1</sup>I had just completed my freshman year of high school and had no idea what I was in for.
                <sup>2</sup>There are no venues or theaters that are completely full. There will be no one-on-one classes or chance encounters with strangers.
                <sup>3</sup>Due to the obstacles and pandemics that have afflicted our country. I have been able to overcome and overcome the problems that have arisen in my life as a college student or, to put it another way, during my college years. 
                <sup>4</sup>As we enter our college years, we aren't getting any younger. We're getting on in years. As we go through the phases of maturity, we realize that we will have more responsibilities as we become older.
                <sup>5</sup>Many college students would prefer this year's distance, separation, and caution. Regardless, many students learned that the unexpected stoppage of campus activities during the coronavirus pandemic had both positive and negative consequences.
                <sup>6</sup>I had no idea what to anticipate from online education. I had to deal with the pressures of being a college student, especially since most universities and colleges have a full-day schedule, despite the fact that you spend the most of your time staring at a screen.
                <sup>7</sup>As a college student or throughout my college years, I understood that achieving anything on my own made me stronger. I admit that one of my characteristics or personality traits before to entering college was relying on my classmates to finish a task or project. 
                <sup>8</sup>Even though it's online, I have a lot of memories from college. My classmates become my pals as a result of my peers.
                <sup>9</sup>I believed I'd be able to finish college on my own, but I was mistaken. At University of the East, I met a lot of weird people, which is why I have someone I can trust.
                <sup>10</sup>My friends and I are assisting each other in planning a variety of tasks that we will need to complete in order to pass and graduate from college, as well as to learn.
                <sup>11</sup>However, we are not solely concerned with our academic performance.
                <sup>12</sup>We also unwind by playing video games online. We frequently play the game Valorant, which strengthens our friendship.
                <sup>13</sup>And I also playing Axie Infinity to get some extra income.
                <sup>14</sup>I am learning all about NFT's/ crypto because i watch some other contents that is our future is crypto.
                <sup>15</sup>This pandemic feels me so alone because i'm the only child.
                <sup>16</sup>I always home alone with my 2 dogs.
                <sup>17</sup>It is so depressing because you don't have someone to talk to all day.
                <sup>18</sup>But luckily i have my pc to escape my loneliness everyday.
                <sup>19</sup>I'm so grateful that i meet some new friends even though it is online.
                <sup>20</sup>I wish i could meet them all.
