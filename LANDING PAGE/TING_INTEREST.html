                <sup>12</sup>The most recent skill I acquired was when I learnt to program. I was able to gain experience in problem-solving. I also improved my critical thinking skills,
                <sup>13</sup>which are necessary for creating your own program, one day i created a game named called Snake, tetris and Typing game.

                <sup>16</sup>I believe that enthusiasm to learn is another of my abilities.

            <p font face="Garamond" font size="6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup>1</sup>I am a lifelong learner with a wide range of interests.
                <sup>2</sup>For starters, I'm interested in gaming since I've always wanted to be a pro gamer.
                <sup>3</sup>But it was only this year that I discovered it. I understand that it is too late to change my opinion
                <sup>4</sup>I must complete college and pursue a profession as a pro gamer
                <sup>5</sup>I enjoy gaming objects or situations because it allows me to create memories in the present.
                <sup>6</sup>My friends and my former team who works in the pro gaming industry, have both motivated me.
                <sup>7</sup>I'm also interested in editing since it's fantastic to be able to create amazing effects like VFX or CGI that will improve your video. 
                <sup>8</sup>It can be used to improve photos and videos.
                <sup>9</sup>I believe this is a good career or in high demand because many individuals are vlogging these days, and it is effective for businesses to promote themselves by making videos.
                <sup>10</sup>Anyway, despite my passion for gaming. I'm also fascinated by computers
                <sup>11</sup>As I've been using computers and gadgets since I was a child, and they've occupied nearly half of my life
                <sup>12</sup>Now that I'm in my second year, I've learned a lot in my classes. Another thing that fascinates me is how people excel at art.
                <sup>13</sup>When I see paintings or drawings, I sometimes wonder what the meaning is, and when I see paintings at a museum, I sometimes wonder what the meaning is.
                <sup>14</sup>It makes me feel better since i can identify to what the author is saying
                <sup>15</sup>I like to sing or compose a song when it comes to expressing oneself
                <sup>16</sup>Another thing that interests me is learning how to build video games.
                <sup>17</sup>Making games is something I've wanted to do since high school
                <sup>18</sup>but I've had second thoughts because I believe it's difficult and not for me,
                <sup>19</sup>so I changed my mind and chose BSIT.
                <sup>20</sup>I believe I have covered all of my interests here, and I appreciate you for your time.
